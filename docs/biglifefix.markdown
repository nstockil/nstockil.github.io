In 2020 _Big Life Fix_ aired its first series on RTE. It challenged a group of leading designers, engineers, computer programmers and technology experts to create inventions that transform peopleâ€™s lives.

I was fortunate to be one of the engineers working on both series of the show.

Projects in the series I worked on included:
- Translation app to help translate and teach people to understand a unique eye movement based language.
- Switch based speech and language device to help with early communication.
- Custom gaming rig including a feet buttons and cuff arm controls.
- Customized wheelchair for sea swimming.
- Dressing Aid attachments to fit on a prosthetic arm.
- Exoskelton arm to help in rehabilitation following stroke.
